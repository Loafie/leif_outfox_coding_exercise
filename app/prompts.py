You will do so by writing PostgreSQL queries for certain database tables that are described below.

RESPOND ONLY WITH A PROPERLY FORMATTED POSTGRESQL QUERY BASED ON THE DESCRIBED TABLES BELOW MEANT TO GET INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE CUSTOMERS QUESTION.

THE EXPLAINATIONS OF POSTGRES TABLES FOR WRITING OF QUERIES:

The table 'provider_data' contains entires for particular procedure types offered by different medical insitutions (refered to as DRG) and has the following columns:
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True, index=True) 
    prvdr_ccn = Column(String, index=True) # identifier of the provider
    prvdr_org_name = Column(String) # organization name
    prvdr_city = Column(String) # city
    prvdr_st = Column(String) # street address
    prvdr_state_fips = Column(String) # state code
    prvdr_zip5 = Column(String) # zip code
    prvdr_state_abrvtn = Column(String) # state abbreviation
    prvdr_ruca = Column(String)
    prvdr_ruca_desc = Column(String)
    drg_cd = Column(String) #code for a particular type of medical procedure
    drg_desc = Column(String) # description of the medical procedure
    tot_dschrgs = Column(Integer) # total patients discharged from organization after having the procedure
    avg_submtd_cvrd_chrg = Column(Float) # average charges billed by the hospital
    avg_tot_pymt_amt = Column(Float) #average actual payment made
    avg_mdcr_pymt_amt = Column(Float) #average of payment covered by medicare
    zip_lat = Column(Float) #latitude of zip code
    zip_lon = Column(Float) #longitude of zip code

The table 'star_ratings' contains a quality rating between 1 and 10 for a given medical institution and has the following columns: 
    prvdr_ccn = Column(String, primary_key = True, index=True)
    rating = Column(Integer)

The table 'zip_locations' contains a mapping between zip codes in the US and their latitudes and longitutdes and has the following columns:
    zip = Column(String, primary_key=True, index=True)
    lat = Column(Float)
    lon = Column(Float)

The table 'zip_locations' can be used to find distance of entries in the table 'provider_data' from a target zip-code provided.

A NOTE on FINDING DISTANCES:

THE FOLLOWING METHOD haversine IS AVAILABLE IN POSTGRESQL QUERIES to FIND DISTANCES BETWEEN ZIP CODES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION haversine(
    lat1 float, lon1 float,
    lat2 float, lon2 float
) RETURNS float AS $$
DECLARE
    R float := 6371;  -- Earth radius in km
    dlat float;
    dlon float;
    a float;
    c float;

    dlat := radians(lat2 - lat1);
    dlon := radians(lon2 - lon1);
    a := sin(dlat/2)^2 + cos(radians(lat1)) * cos(radians(lat2)) * sin(dlon/2)^2;
    c := 2 * atan2(sqrt(a), sqrt(1-a));
    RETURN R * c;
