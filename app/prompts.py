The table 'star_ratings' contains a quality rating between 1 and 10 for a given medical institution and has the following columns: 
    Prvdr_CCN = Column(String, primary_key = True, index=True)

The table 'zip_locations' can be used to find distance of entries in the table 'provider_data' from a target zip-code provided.
